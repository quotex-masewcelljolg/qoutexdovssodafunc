## Quotex Trading Guide

If you are new to trading, it is important to learn the basics before
you start using a trading bot. Here are a few tips to help you get
started:

-   **Choose the right market:** Not all markets are suitable for
    trading with a bot. Some markets are more volatile than others, and
    some have different trading hours. It is important to choose a
    market that you are familiar with and that has a good track record.
-   **Set realistic expectations:** Trading bots are not magic bullets.
    They cannot guarantee profits. It is important to set realistic
    expectations and to understand that there is always some risk
    involved in trading.
-   **Monitor your bot:** Once you have started using a trading bot, it
    is important to monitor it regularly. Make sure that the bot is
    still executing trades as expected and that it is not making any
    large losses.
